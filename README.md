# openFDA API Project

The purpose of this project is to create a application that scans the openFDA database to search for medical device review committees and alerts the user if new medical devices have been approved. This applicaion would be useful to medical device companies who want to keep track of the competitive landscape.

OpenFDA is an Elasticsearch-based API that serves public FDA data about nouns like drugs, devices, and foods.
